<h2>3. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)</h2>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is very popular in programming world and in Spring it is well implemented. Developer can use Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP feature of Spring to develop application in which business logic is separated from system services.</p>

<h2>4. Container</h2>

<p>Spring provides their own abstraction of JDBC exception which further simplify the exception handling in program.</p>

<h1>Benefits of Spring Framework</h1>
Here are advantages of Spring Framework:

<h2>1. Solving difficulties of Enterprise application development</h2>
<p>Spring is solving the difficulties of development of complex applications, it provides Spring Core,  Spring IoC and Spring AOP for integrating various components of business applications.</p>

2. Support Enterprise application development through POJOs

Spring supports development of Enterprise application development using the POJO classes which removes the need of importing heavy Enterprise container during development. This makes application testing much easier.

3. Easy integration other frameworks

Spring designed to be used with all other frameworks of Java, you can use ORM, Struts, Hibernate and other frameworks of Java together. Spring framework do not impose any restriction on the frameworks to be used together.
