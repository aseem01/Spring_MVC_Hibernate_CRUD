    <h1>Spring MVC Framework</h1>
   <p> Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code.</p>

<p>Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.</p>

<p>Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB.</p>

<p>The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.</p>
    <h1> Features of Spring Framework</h1>
Spring framework is feature rich framework and it comes with following features:

<h4>1. Lightweight</h4>

<p>Spring is modular lightweight framework which allows you to selectively use any of its module on the top of Spring Core.</p>
<h4> 2. Inversion Of Control (IOC)</h4>
<p>This is another top feature of Spring framework where application dependencies are satisfied by the framework itself. Framework creates the object in runtime and satisfies application dependencies.</p>

<h4>3. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)</h4>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is very popular in programming world and in Spring it is well implemented. Developer can use Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP feature of Spring to develop application in which business logic is separated from system services.</p>

<h4>4. Container</h4>
<p>Spring provides their own container for managing the bean lifecycle.</p>
<h4>5. MVC Framework</h4>
<p>Spring MVC Framework is used for developing MVC based web applications.</p>
<h4>6. Transaction Management</h4>
<p>Spring framework provides generic Transaction Management layer which can be used with or without J2EE(JEE) environment.</p>
<h4>7. JDBC Exception Handling</h4>
<p>Spring provides their own abstraction of JDBC exception which further simplify the exception handling in program.</p>

<h1>Benefits of Spring Framework</h1>
Here are advantages of Spring Framework:

<h4>1. Solving difficulties of Enterprise application development</h4>
<p>Spring is solving the difficulties of development of complex applications, it provides Spring Core,  Spring IoC and Spring AOP for integrating various components of business applications.</p>

<h4>2. Support Enterprise application development through POJOs</h4>

<p>Spring supports development of Enterprise application development using the POJO classes which removes the need of importing heavy Enterprise container during development. This makes application testing much easier.</p>

<h4>3. Easy integration other frameworks</h4>
<p>Spring designed to be used with all other frameworks of Java, you can use ORM, Struts, Hibernate and other frameworks of Java together. Spring framework do not impose any restriction on the frameworks to be used together.</p>
<h4>4. Application Testing</h4>
<p>Spring Container can be used to develop and run test cases outside enterprise container which makes testing much easier.</p>
<h4>5. Modularity</h4>
<p>Spring framework is modular framework and it comes with many modules such as Spring MVC, Spring ORM, Spring JDBC, Spring Transactions etc. which can used as per application requirement in modular fashion.</p>
<h4>6. Spring Transaction Management</h4>
<p>Spring Transaction Management interface is very flexible it can configured to use local transactions in small application which can be scaled to JTA for global transactions.</p>
